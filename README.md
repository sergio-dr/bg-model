# Usage
```
usage: bgoptimizer.py [-h] [-dx DOWNSCALING_FACTOR] [-df DOWNSCALING_FUNC] [-dq DELINEARIZATION_QUANTILE] [-p] [-N N]
                      [-O O] [-tm THRESHOLD_MIN] [-tM THRESHOLD_MAX] [-m MASK] [-i INITIALIZER] [-e EPOCHS] [-a ALPHA]
                      [-B B] [-lr LR]
                      input_file [output_path]
```

Generates a spline based background model (by gradient descent optimization) for the input (linear) image. Both the
background-subtracted image and background model are written to the specified output directory (appending
'_bgSubtracted' and 'bgModel' suffixes to the original filename). A mask can be specified by providing a grayscale
mask image, or by providing a (min, max) threshold range (outside this range, pixels are masked). Fully masked pixels
are ignored during optimization, so masks are helpful, e.g., for ignorig missing values after registration, or very
bright regions, when fitting the spline. Only XISF files are supported.

```
positional arguments:
  input_file            Input filename. Must be in XISF format, in linear state
  output_path           Path for the output files (by default, the current directory) (default: .)

  -df DOWNSCALING_FUNC, --downscaling-func DOWNSCALING_FUNC

## Usage guidelines

1. As the background model is expected to be smooth, the optimization process is executed on a downscaled version on the input image, for performance. For very large or very small images you may want to change the `--downscaling-factor` value. 
1. You should stretch the data to reveal the background using the `--preview` mode. In this step you will want to fine tune the `--delinearization-quantile` value, that controls the amount of stretch (lower values imply more stretching). Don't worry about the highlights as long as you don't blown out the brightest parts of the background gradient. Example:
    ```
    bgoptimizer.py input.xisf -dq 0.9 -p
    ```
1. Check if you want to mask out too dim or too bright features. Fully masked pixels will be ignored by the optimizer. This may help if there are "black borders" resulting from registration, or if the data contains missing values (typically mapped to zero), or if bright nebulosity is present. In many cases, simply providing `--threshold-max` and `--threshold-min` values may be enough to get a decent mask. For example, in skyscapes, sometimes the foreground is darker than the sky, and it may simply masked out with `--threshold-min`. In other cases, you may want to create a more elaborated mask with another tool and provide it with the `--mask` option. This step should be also tried with the `--preview` mode. Example:
    ```
    bgoptimizer.py input.xisf -dq 0.9 -tM 0.75 -p
    ```
1. When you are happy with the delinearization and masking, its time to give a run to the optimization process. In this step you may want to fine tune the number of control points, `-N`, the initializer `--initializer` and the number or iterations or epochs, `--epochs`. The optimizer early stops when there is no further improvement, so the provided epochs value may not be reached. The default values of the rest of the parameters usually work well. Example:
    ```
    bgoptimizer.py input.xisf -dq 0.9 -tM 0.75 -N 64 -e 5000
    ```
